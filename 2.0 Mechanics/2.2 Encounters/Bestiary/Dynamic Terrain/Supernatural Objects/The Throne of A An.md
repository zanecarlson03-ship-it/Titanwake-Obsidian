      - effect: >-
          In the Age of Suns, there was no darkness and no night. Even among the
          many suns of that time, the light of A'An was the brightest. The
          throne of A'An manifests the sun powers of that god, even when no one
          is seated in it. The following effects always occur within 10 squares
          of the throne:


          - The throne sheds bright light that negates all darkness and
          concealment, and which prevents creatures from being hidden.

          - Any creature with cold immunity has fire weakness 10.

          - Any creature who uses an ability that deals cold damage takes 11
          fire damage.

    name: Sitting on the Throne
    icon: ⭐️
    effects:
      - effect: Only a creature attuned to the throne can sit on it. A creature adjacent
          to the throne can use a main action to attune to it by succeeding on a
          **Presence test**.
        tier1: The creature takes 11 fire damage.
        tier2: The creature fails to attune to the throne.
        tier3: The creature attunes to the throne and can sit on it.
      - effect: >-
          A creature seated on the throne becomes the hierophant of A'An and
          gains the following benefits:


          - The hierophant and each of their allies within 10 squares of the
          throne have fire immunity 10.

          - The hierophant and each of their allies within 10 squares of the
          throne can choose to have their abilities deal fire damage instead of
          their usual damage.

          - The hierophant has a +5 bonus to stability, and any strike made
          against them takes a bane unless the attacker is also attuned to the
          throne.

          - The hierophant can use the **Primordial Flare** and **Solar
          Accretion** abilities.
