          them. Each enemy in that area who has A < 3 is bleeding (save ends).
          Additionally, the area is difficult terrain, and any enemy takes 3
          poison damage for each square of the area they enter. An enemy who
          takes 9 poison damage this way on one turn is weakened until the end
          of the encounter.
