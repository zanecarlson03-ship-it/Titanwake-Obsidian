      - name: Effect
        effect: The target must be size 1L or smaller. The shambling mound reaches out
          with writhing vines, and if the target has A < 3, they are engulfed
          into the shambling mound's sack. If the target is grabbed by the
          shambling mound, the potency increases by 1. An engulfed creature is
          restrained, takes 3 poison damage at the start of each turn, and can't
          take damage from abilities used from outside the sack. When the
          shambling mound moves, the engulfed creature moves with them. If the
          shambling mound dies or their sack is destroyed, each engulfed
          creature is freed and appears in an unoccupied space within 2 squares
          of the shambling mound.
      - cost: 2+ Malice
        effect: The shambling mound can engulf one additional target for each 2 Malice
