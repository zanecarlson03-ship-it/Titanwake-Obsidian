name: Ajax's Malice
flavor: At the start of Ajax's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the
  following features.
features:
  - type: feature
    feature_type: trait
    name: Reason
    icon: 👤
    cost: 2 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect
          through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason
          test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one
          target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action
          during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same
          creature during the same encounter.

    feature_type: trait
    name: Nexus Jewel
    icon: 🌀
    cost: 5 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following
          environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment
          on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.
      - name: Incredibly High Above the Ground
        effect: The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a −3
          penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to
          their distance against such creatures.
      - name: Swamp
        effect: The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and
          ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).
      - name: Volcanic Canyon
        effect: The air is stiflingly hot. Each enemy takes 5 fire damage for each
          square they enter.
  - type: feature
    feature_type: trait
    name: Solo Action
    icon: ☠️

          feature even if he is dazed.

    distance: Four 3 cubes within 10
    target: Each enemy and object in the area
    effects:
      - name: Effect
        effect: Each target makes a test using their highest characteristic.
        tier1: 26 damage; bleeding and slowed (save ends)
        tier2: 22 damage; bleeding (save ends)
        tier3: 16 damage
      - effect: Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant
          blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed
          into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is
          resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by
          Ajax at will (no action required).
