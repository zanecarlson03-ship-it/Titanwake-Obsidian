          encounter, each creature who starts their turn on the ground and can't
          burrow must spend 1 additional square of movement to leave their
          starting position, or 2 squares if they start their turn prone or
          underground. A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same
          space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.
