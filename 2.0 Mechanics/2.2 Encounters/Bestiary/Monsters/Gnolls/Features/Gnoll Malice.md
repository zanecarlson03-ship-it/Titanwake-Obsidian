    name: Iron Jaws
    icon: 🔳
    cost: 3 Malice
    keywords:

    usage: Maneuver
    distance: 1 cube within 3

    effects:
      - name: Effect
        effect: A gnoll acting this turn drops an iron-jawed snare into the area. The
          first time any enemy moves into the area, they make an **Agility
          test**. If they were unaware of the snare, the test takes a bane.
        tier1: 6 damage; bleeding (save ends)
        tier2: 4 damage; bleeding (EoT)
        tier3: No effect.
      - name: Effect
        effect: While an enemy is bleeding this way, each gnoll in the encounter gains
          an edge on strikes made against them.

    name: Bloodpool
    icon: 👤
    cost: 5 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: One gnoll minion suddenly explodes into a pool of blood, splattering the
          area within 3 squares of them. Any gnoll who starts their turn in this
          area deals an extra 5 damage on their next strike before the end of
          their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena who starts their turn in
          the area turns into a **gnoll marauder**, keeping their current
          Stamina.

    name: Echoes of Laughter
    icon: 🌀
    cost: 7 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map is encased in a
          soundscape of laughter and howling. Each enemy takes a bane on the
          first power roll they make each round. Whenever a gnoll is killed,
          this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.
