    name: Solo Monster
    icon: ☠️
    effects:
      - name: End Effect
        effect: At the end of each of their turns, the dragon can take 15 damage to end
          one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage
          can't be reduced in any way.

          consecutively.

    feature_type: trait
    name: Deathcount
    icon: ⭐️
    effects:
      - effect: Several of the dragon's abilities impose a Deathcount on a target. At
          the end of every turn, a creature with a Deathcount who is within the
          area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura has that Deathcount
          reduced by 1. When a creature's Deathcount hits 0, they die. If
          multiple Deathcounts are imposed on a creature, they don't stack. Only
          the lowest Deathcount takes effect. All Deathcounts are lost when the
          dragon is reduced to 0 Stamina.

    icon: ❇️
    effects:
      - effect: The dragon's scales create a 4 aura of supernatural stagnancy around
          them. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and no creature
          except the omen dragon can regain Stamina while in the area. Any
          creature dragonsealed by the omen dragon who starts their turn in the
          dragon's aura and doesn't have a Deathcount gains a Deathcount of 12.
