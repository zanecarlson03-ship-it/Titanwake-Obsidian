    effects:
      - effect: The dragon drops stars into five 2 cubes anywhere on the encounter map.
          The area is difficult terrain, and each creature and object in the
          area when it appears makes an **Agility test**.

    name: Event Horizon
    icon: ☠️
    cost: 10 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: A black hole manifests as a 1 cube within 20 squares of the dragon in an
          unoccupied space. Each creature who has M < 5 and each object of size
          3 or smaller is vertical pulled 2 squares toward the area at the start
          of each round, ignoring stability. Any creature who starts their turn
          in the area or any object in the area at the end of the round suffers
          the effect of the dragon's Voidlight Breath ability, and the black
          hole disappears.
