    feature_type: trait
    name: Cloud of Deceit
    icon: 🌀
    cost: 7 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: >-
          The lich summons a mind-altering mist, turns invisible until the start
          of their next turn, and moves up to half their speed. Each enemy
          within 20 squares of the lich's starting point who has I < 4 is
          deceived. While deceived, a creature perceives all allies and enemies
          as the lich, and perceives the environment as an unfamiliar wasteland
          corrupted by necrotic blight. If other creatures attempt to
          communicate with a deceived creature, that creature interprets their
          words as ghastly taunts in the lich's voice.


          This effect lasts until an affected creature takes damage or an ally
          uses a main action to shake them out of it. Each time this feature is
          used during an encounter, the distance of the effect decreases by 5
          squares (to a minimum of 5 squares) and the potency increases by 1.
