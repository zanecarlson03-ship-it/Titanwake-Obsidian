        effect: The glutton shifts up to their speed in a straight line, ignoring
          difficult terrain. The first time during this movement that the
          glutton moves through the space of a creature or object their size or
          smaller, that creature or object takes 10 damage, or a creature can
          choose to fall prone instead. If the glutton moves into a creature or
          object larger than them and doesn't knock the creature prone or
          destroy the object, the glutton's movement ends and they are dazed
          until the end of their next turn.
