      - name: Effect
        effect: If a target is already slowed, the potency increases by 1 for that
          target. A target restrained this way magically begins to turn to
          stone, and a target who ends two consecutive turns restrained this way
          is petrified. A target restrained this way or a creature adjacent to
          them can use a main action to cut encroaching stone from the target's
          body, dealing 8 damage to the target that can't be reduced in any way
          and ending this effect.
