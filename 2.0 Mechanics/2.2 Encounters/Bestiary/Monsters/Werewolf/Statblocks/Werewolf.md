      - name: End Effect
        effect: At the end of each of their turns, the werewolf can take 5 damage to end
          one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage
          can't be reduced in any way.

    name: Accursed Rage
    icon: ⭐️
    effects:
      - effect: The werewolf's ferocity is expressed through rage, and their abilities
          can inflict rage points on any enemy except a stormwight fury. A
          creature who starts their turn with 10 or more rage expends their
          rage. Then before taking their turn, they must shift up to their speed
          toward the nearest creature and make a melee free strike against them.
          A creature who takes damage from this free strike gains 1 rage.
          Accumulated rage disappears after a character finishes a respite.

          of each of their turns whenever they're in combat. Their rage doesn't
          disappear after finishing a respite and they must complete the Find a
