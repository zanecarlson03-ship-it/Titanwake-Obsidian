          gravity well sits at the center of the cube and lasts until the end of
          the encounter, or until a creature adjacent to the well uses a
          maneuver to deactivate it. The area is difficult terrain for enemies.

          toward the well.

          field (no action required). While the field is up, each non-time
          raider on the map makes a **Reason test** against this psionic effect
          at the start of each round.
