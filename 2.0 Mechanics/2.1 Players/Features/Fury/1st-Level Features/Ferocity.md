        effects:
          - effect: Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, you might find yourself
              asking, "Where's the special maneuver for the fury?" The answer is
              that the class doesn't need its own maneuver, because most of the
              time, the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback
              maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too,
              so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll
              rarely or never use.

      ##### Ferocity in Combat


      At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
      tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain
      ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns
      during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

      Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you
      gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an
      encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

      You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.

      ##### Ferocity Outside of Combat

      Though you can't gain ferocity outside of combat, you can use your heroic
      abilities and effects that cost ferocity without spending it. Whenever you
      use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs ferocity, you can't
      use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1
      or more Victories or finish a respite.

      When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited
      ferocity on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if
      you had spent an amount of ferocity equal to your Victories.
