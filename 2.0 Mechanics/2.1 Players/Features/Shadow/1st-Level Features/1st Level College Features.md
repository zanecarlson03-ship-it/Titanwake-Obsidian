      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: I'm No Threat
        flavor: Taking on an illusory countenance gives you an advantage on subterfuge.
        keywords:

        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              You envelop yourself in an illusion that makes you appear
              nonthreatening and harmless to your enemies. You might take on the
              appearance of a harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or
              capybara, or you might appear as a less heroic and unarmed version
              of yourself. While this illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge,
              and when you take the Disengage move action, you gain a +1 bonus
              to the distance you can shift.

              The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you
              physically interact with a creature, when you use this ability
              again, or when you end the illusion (no action required). If you
              end this illusion by harming another creature, you gain 1 surge.
          - cost: Spend 1 Insight
            effect: Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and
              who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear
              as that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including
              clothing and armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of
              the creature. You gain an edge on tests made to convince the
              creature's allies that you are the creature.
  - effect: >-
      ##### Smoke Bomb


      You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to use for distractions and easy
      getaways. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and don't
      initially have cover or concealment. When you do so, you can shift a
      number of squares equal to your Agility score. If you end this movement
      with cover or concealment, you are automatically hidden.
