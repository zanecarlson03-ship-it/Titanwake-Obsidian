      Your shadow college grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level
      College Features table.


      ###### 8th-Level College Features Table

      | College         | Feature     |

      | --------------- | ----------- |

      | Black Ash       | Cinder Step |

      | Caustic Alchemy | Time Bomb   |

      | Harlequin Mask  | Parkour     |

      ##### Cinder Step

      Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport. When you teleport this way,
      it counts as using a shadow ability for the purpose of using your Burning
      Ash and Trail of Cinders features.

      ##### Parkour

      Your movement no longer provokes opportunity attacks. Additionally, you
      can use your Harlequin Gambit feature as a free triggered action when a
      creature is reduced to 0 Stamina by your Clever Trick ability.

      ##### Time Bomb

      You have damage immunity against area abilities and effects equal to your
      Agility score. You also have the following ability, which you can use once
      per round on your turn.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Time Bomb
        flavor: The longer it cooks, the bigger the boom.
        keywords:
          - Area
          - Ranged
        usage: Free maneuver
        distance: 2 cube within 10
        target: Each enemy in the area
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              Each target takes acid, fire, or poison damage (your choice) equal
              to your Agility score.

              For each combat round that has passed since this ability was last
              used in the current encounter, the area increases by 1 and you
              gain 1 surge that must be used with this ability. After using the
              ability or at the end of the encounter, its area and surges are
              reset.
          - cost: Spend 2+ Insight
            effect: For every 2 insight spent, you increase the cube's size by 1 and gain 1
              surge that can be used only with this ability.
