            effect: You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen.
              The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't
              physically interact with the world. While you are within 10
              squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that
              type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own
              surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action
              required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and
              you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.
