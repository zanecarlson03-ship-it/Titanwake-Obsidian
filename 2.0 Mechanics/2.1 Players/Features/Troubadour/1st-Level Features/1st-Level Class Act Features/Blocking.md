          - name: Effect
            effect: At the end of each of your turns while this performance is active, you
              can choose up to a number of targets equal to your Presence score
              and teleport those targets to unoccupied spaces in the area. A
              target can't be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as
              over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a
              condition or other negative effect.
