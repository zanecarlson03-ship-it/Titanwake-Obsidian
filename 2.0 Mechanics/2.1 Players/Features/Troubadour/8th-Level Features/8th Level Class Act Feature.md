            effect: While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to
              continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a
              target can move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but
              can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions. At the end of the
              encounter, each target who chose to take turns this way turns to
              dust and blows away.

        name: Radical Fantasia
        flavor: 𝅘𝅥𝅮♪Viras, my Viras, will you hold their hands as they cryyy—aaaiigh?♪
        keywords:
          - Area
          - Magic
          - Performance
        usage: No action
        distance: 5 aura
        target: Self and each ally in the area
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in
              the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that
              imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement
              distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per
              combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free
              triggered action.
  - effect: >-
      ##### Deleted Scene


      Whenever a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue ability
      makes a power roll, you can spend 1 drama as a free triggered action to
      use Dramatic Monologue, targeting only one creature.

      ##### Masterwork

      Choose one of your signature abilities and name it after yourself. You
      always have this ability available, even if it is sourced from a kit you
      switch out. Whenever you use this ability, you gain an edge and 1 surge
      that you can use only on this ability.

      Additionally, when your named signature ability is the last ability you
      use in an encounter, you can immediately use the Hear Ye, Hear Ye! effect
      of your Zeitgeist feature to tell tales of your exploits after the
      encounter ends.
