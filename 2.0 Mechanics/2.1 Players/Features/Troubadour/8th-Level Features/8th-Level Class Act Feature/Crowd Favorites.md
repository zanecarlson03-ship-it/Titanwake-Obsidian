            effect: While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to
              continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a
              target can move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but
              can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions. At the end of the
              encounter, each target who chose to take turns this way turns to
              dust and blows away.

              the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that
              imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement
              distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per
              combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free
              triggered action.
