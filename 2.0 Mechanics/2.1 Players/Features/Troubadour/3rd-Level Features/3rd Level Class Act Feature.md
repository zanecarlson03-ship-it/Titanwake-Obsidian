      Your troubadour class act grants you a feature, as shown on the 3rd-Level
      Class Act Features table.


      ###### 3rd-Level Class Act Features Table

      | Class Act | Features     |

      | --------- | ------------ |

      | Auteur    | Missed Cue   |

      | Duelist   | Foil         |

      | Virtuoso  | Second Album |

      ##### Foil

      At the start of an encounter, choose one creature within your line of
      effect. You have a double edge on power rolls made against or in
      competition with that creature. The chosen creature also has a double edge
      on power rolls made against or in competition with you. If the chosen
      creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can choose a new foil at the start
      of the next combat round.

      ##### Missed Cue

      If you aren't surprised at the start of an encounter, you can choose one
      enemy within your line of effect who is not a leader or solo creature. The
      Director temporarily removes the chosen creature from the encounter. The
      chosen creature enters the encounter at the start of the second combat
      round. You must earn 3 Victories before you can use this feature again.

      ##### Second Album

      You have the following performance abilities, which are usable with your
      Routines feature.
