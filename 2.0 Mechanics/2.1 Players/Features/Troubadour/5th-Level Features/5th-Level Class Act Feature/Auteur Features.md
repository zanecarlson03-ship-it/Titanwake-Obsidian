      ###### Fix It in Post

      Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one
      condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue
      ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: bleeding,
      frightened, prone, slowed, or taunted. You change that condition to
      another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the
      original condition. A target who is no longer prone can stand up.
