      Choose one of the following features.


      ###### Verbal Duel

      Once on each of your turns while the target of your Foil feature is
      adjacent to you, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with them.
      Make an opposed Presence test with the target. Whoever gets the higher
      result can make a free strike, which deals psychic damage instead of its
      usual damage.

      ###### We Can't Be Upstaged!

      You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your
      Routines feature.
