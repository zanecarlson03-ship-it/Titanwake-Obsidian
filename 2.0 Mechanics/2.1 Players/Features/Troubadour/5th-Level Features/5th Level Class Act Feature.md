      Your troubadour class act grants your choice of one of two features.


      ##### Auteur Features

      Choose one of the following features.

      ###### Fix It in Post

      Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to change one
      condition affecting a creature within distance of your Dramatic Monologue
      ability. Choose one of the following conditions on the target: bleeding,
      frightened, prone, slowed, or taunted. You change that condition to
      another of those conditions, maintaining the duration and origin of the
      original condition. A target who is no longer prone can stand up.

      ###### Take Two!

      You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your
      Routines feature.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Take Two!
        flavor: One more, and this time make it interesting.
        keywords:
          - Area
          - Magic
          - Performance
        usage: No action
        distance: 5 aura
        target: Self and each ally in the area
        effects:

            effect: While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in
              the area can reroll the first power roll that turn that obtains a
              tier 2 outcome. They must use the new roll.

      ##### Duelist Features


      Choose one of the following features.

      ###### Verbal Duel

      Once on each of your turns while the target of your Foil feature is
      adjacent to you, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words with them.
      Make an opposed Presence test with the target. Whoever gets the higher
      result can make a free strike, which deals psychic damage instead of its
      usual damage.

      ###### We Can't Be Upstaged!

      You have the following performance ability, which is usable with your
      Routines feature.

        name: We Can't Be Upstaged!
        flavor: Swordplay so graceful it looks like you all practiced this.

        target: Self and each ally in the area
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: While this performance is active, a target who starts their turn in the
              area gains a bonus to the distance they can shift equal to your
              Presence score until the end of their turn.
  - effect: >-
      ##### Virtuoso Features


      Choose one of the following features.

      ###### Bolstering Banter

      Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to exchange words
      with a target of your current performance, other than yourself. The target
      can spend a Recovery to gain temporary Stamina equal to their recovery
      value.

      ###### Medley

      You can maintain two performances at a time using your Routines feature.
