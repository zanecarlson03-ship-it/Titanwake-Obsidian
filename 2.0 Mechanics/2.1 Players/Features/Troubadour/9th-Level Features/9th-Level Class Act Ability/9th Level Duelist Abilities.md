              half that total Stamina and the target has the remainder. If
              either of you would gain more Stamina this way than their Stamina
              maximum, the difference in Stamina between what that creature
              would gain and their maximum is gained by the other creature.
              Neither of you can gain more Stamina than your maximum this way.
              You then make a power roll.

              saving throw or that end at the end of your turns.
            tier3: You can choose any of the current effects on you and the target that are
              ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of your turns,
              apply the chosen effects to the target, and end the rest.
