              Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following
              benefits:

              - Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target
              becoming size 3. Each creature who is within the target's new
              space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability.
              If the target doesn't have space to grow, they grow as much as
              they can and become restrained until the effect ends.

              - They have fire immunity 10.

              - Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason
              score.

              - When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced
              movement distance gains a +2 bonus.

              - They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for
              Might power rolls.
          - name: Persistent 2
            effect: The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the
              start of your turn, the target can spend 2 Recoveries.

          - name: Effect
            effect: If the target is teleported to a space where they would fall, they
              immediately do so, treating the fall as if their Agility score
              were 0. The target takes fire damage from the fall, and each enemy
              within 3 squares of where they land takes the same amount of fire
              damage. The ground within 3 squares of where the target lands is
              difficult terrain.
