      Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the
      1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.


      ###### 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

      | Specialization | Feature                    |

      | -------------- | -------------------------- |

      | Earth          | Motivate Earth             |

      | Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |

      | Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |

      | Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

      ##### A Beyonding of Vision

      You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible
      creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects
      from you. Additionally, you always know if an area or object you observe
      is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that
      magic can do.

      You also gain the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Shared Void Sense
        flavor: You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.
        keywords:
          - Magic
          - Ranged
          - Void
        usage: Maneuver
        distance: Ranged 10
        target: Special
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target
              gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the
              end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void
              Sense ability.
  - effect: >-
      ##### It Is the Soul Which Hears


      You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures,
      even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate
      with these creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but
      you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence
      them.

      Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to
      communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with
      the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and
      sensations that can't be overly specific.

      ##### Motivate Earth

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Motivate Earth
        flavor: The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command.
        keywords:
          - Earth
          - Magic
          - Melee
        usage: Main action
        distance: Melee 1
        target: Special
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and
              create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the
              ground and must include the square you touched.

              Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone,
              or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square
              opening in the structure where you touched it. You can instead
              touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or
              smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is
              sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.
  - effect: |-
      ##### Return to Formlessness

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Return to Formlessness
        flavor: With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.
        keywords:
          - Fire
          - Magic
          - Melee
        usage: Main action
        distance: Melee 1
        target: One mundane object
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: You heat the target and cause it to melt or combust, destroying it. If
              the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the
              object you touch is destroyed.
