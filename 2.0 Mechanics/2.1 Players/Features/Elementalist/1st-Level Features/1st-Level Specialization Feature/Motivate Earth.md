              You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and
              create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the
              ground and must include the square you touched.

              Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone,
              or metal that occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square
              opening in the structure where you touched it. You can instead
              touch an existing doorway or other opening that is 1 square or
              smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening is
              sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.
