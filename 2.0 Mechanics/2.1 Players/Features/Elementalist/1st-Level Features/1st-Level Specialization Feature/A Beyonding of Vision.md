      You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible
      creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects
      from you. Additionally, you always know if an area or object you observe
      is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that
      magic can do.


      You also gain the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Shared Void Sense
        flavor: You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.

            effect: For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target
              gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the
              end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void
              Sense ability.
