            effect: >-
              Choose one of the following effects:

              - You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its
              distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you
              use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.

              - You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element
              ability and one of the following damage types: acid, cold,
              corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes
              damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.

              - You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason
              score. If you choose this option, you can spend essence to
              teleport 1 additional square for each essence spent.
