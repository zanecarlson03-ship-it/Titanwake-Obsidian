      Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the
      8th-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.


      ###### 8th-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

      | Specialization | Feature                |

      | -------------- | ---------------------- |

      | Earth          | Summon Source of Earth |

      | Fire           | The Flame Primordial   |

      | Green          | Chimeric Manifestation |

      | Void           | Black Hole Star        |

      ##### Black Hole Star

      You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest
      titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one
      creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and
      vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this
      forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced
      movement ignores stability for your allies.

      Additionally, your Mantle of Essence improves. While in the area of the
      aura, enemies and objects have their stability reduced by an amount equal
      to your level.

      ##### Chimeric Manifestation

      Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or
      exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your
      Disciple of the Green feature on your turn.

      Additionally, whenever you use your Disciple of the Green feature, you can
      select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both
      forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms
      grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain
      the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of
      movement from both forms.

      You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For
      example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but
      you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).

      ##### The Flame Primordial

      You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding
      your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they
      take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane
      object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your Return
      to Formlessness ability instead.

      Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire
      weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn.
      This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is
      wearing mostly metal.

      ##### Summon Source of Earth

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Summon Source of Earth
        flavor: The ground rumbles as an elemental bursts forth, ready to serve.
        keywords:
          - Earth
          - Magic
          - Ranged
        usage: Main action
        distance: Ranged 10
        target: Special
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: >-
              A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within
              distance. The source takes their turn immediately after you,
              moving up to their speed and either taking a main action or a
              maneuver. The source is dismissed at the start of your next turn.

              The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains
              their current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are
              dismissed and you use this ability again. They can't regain
              Stamina during the encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced
              to 0, you can't use this ability again until you earn 1 or more
              Victories.
          - name: Persistent 2
            effect: >-
              The source takes another turn. They are dismissed at the start of
              your next turn.
