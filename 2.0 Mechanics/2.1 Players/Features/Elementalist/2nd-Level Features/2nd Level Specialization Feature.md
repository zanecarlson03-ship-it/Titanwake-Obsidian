      Your elemental specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

      ###### 2nd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table
      | Specialization | Feature                   |
      | -------------- | ------------------------- |
      | Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
      | Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
      | Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
      | Void           | There Is No Space Between |
      ##### Disciple of Earth
      Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, and you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level past 2nd.
      ##### Disciple of Fire
      Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level. Additionally, fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.
      At the start of a combat encounter, you gain a number of surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you spend a surge to deal extra damage, you can make that damage fire damage.
      ##### Disciple of the Green
      You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.
      Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.
      You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T animal who fits the rodent type. When you take on an animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls undamaged to the ground (your choice). When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.
      You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. When you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

              which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the
              effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at
              a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or
              any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly
              teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the
              other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their
              forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an
              unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

              At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active,
              you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or
              more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal
              to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force
              moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination
              portal.
