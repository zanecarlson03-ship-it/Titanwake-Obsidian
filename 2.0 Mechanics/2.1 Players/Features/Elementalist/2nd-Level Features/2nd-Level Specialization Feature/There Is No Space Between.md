              You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces within distance,
              which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the
              effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at
              a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or
              any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly
              teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the
              other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their
              forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an
              unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

              At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active,
              you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or
              more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal
              to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force
              moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination
              portal.
