      ###### 3rd-Level Elemental Specialization Features Table

      | Specialization | Feature                          |

      | -------------- | -------------------------------- |

      | Earth          | Earth Accepts Me                 |

      | Fire           | A Conversation With Fire         |

      | Green          | Remember Growth and Sun and Rain |

      | Void           | Distance Is Only Memory          |

      ##### A Conversation With Fire

      When you spend 1 uninterrupted minute in front of a fire, you can speak
      the name of another creature. If that creature is willing to speak to you,
      their image appears in the fire, and they can see you before them in a
      shimmering ball of light. The two of you can speak to each other through
      these images as if you were together in person. As a maneuver, you or the
      creature can end the conversation.

      ##### Distance Is Only Memory

      Each time you finish a respite, you can open a two-way portal that leads
      to any place you have previously been. You and your allies can pass
      through the portal, which remains open for 1 hour or until you dismiss it
      as a main action.

      ##### Earth Accepts Me

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Earth Accepts Me
        flavor: You can slip into the stone.
        keywords:
          - Earth
          - Magic
        usage: Main action
        distance: Self
        target: Self
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: You step into a mundane dirt, metal, or stone object (including a wall)
              that is as large as you or larger. You can remain inside the
              object for as long as you like. While inside the object, you can
              observe events and speak to creatures outside it, but you don't
              have line of effect to anything outside the object and vice versa.
              You can travel through the object freely until you exit it. If the
              object you meld with is destroyed, you take 10 damage and exit the
              object.
