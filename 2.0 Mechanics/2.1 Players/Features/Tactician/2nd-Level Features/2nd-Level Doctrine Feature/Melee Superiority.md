effects:
  - effect: After constant drills, you can more accurately anticipate an enemy's
      plan and thwart their attempts to move across the battlefield. Whenever
      you make an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until
      the end of the current turn.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: When a creature marked by you attempts to move or shift within distance
      of your melee free strike, you can use a free triggered action and spend 2
      focus to make a melee free strike against that creature.
