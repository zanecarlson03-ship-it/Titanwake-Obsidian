      Your tactical doctrine grants you a feature, as shown on the 2nd-Level
      Doctrine Features table.


      ###### 2nd-Level Doctrine Features Table

      | Doctrine   | Feature              |

      | ---------- | -------------------- |

      | Insurgent  | Infiltration Tactics |

      | Mastermind | Goaded               |

      | Vanguard   | Melee Superiority    |

      ##### Goaded

      You have learned to leverage your marked foes' psychology and goad them
      into acting before they're tactically ready. Whenever a creature marked by
      you uses a strike that targets you or any ally within your line of effect,
      you can use a free triggered action to change one target of the strike to
      you or another ally within your line of effect. The new target must be
      within distance of the ability and within line of effect of the creature
      using it.

      ##### Infiltration Tactics

      You have trained your squad to work together, stay silent, and wait for
      the opportune time to strike. Whenever you or any ally within 10 squares
      of you becomes hidden, that creature gains 1 surge.

      ##### Melee Superiority

      After constant drills, you can more accurately anticipate an enemy's plan
      and thwart their attempts to move across the battlefield. Whenever you
      make an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the
      end of the current turn.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: When a creature marked by you attempts to move or shift within distance
      of your melee free strike, you can use a free triggered action and spend 2
      focus to make a melee free strike against that creature.
