        name: Mark
        flavor: You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe—with devastating
          effect.

              The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until
              you are dying, or until you use this ability again. You can
              willingly end your mark on a creature (no action required), and if
              another tactician marks a creature, your mark on that creature
              ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you
              can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within
              distance.

              You can initially mark only one creature using this ability,
              though other tactician abilities allow you to mark additional
              creatures at the same time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's
              Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures
              with this ability starting at 5th level.

              While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you
              and allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls
              made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally
              uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you,
              you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a
              free triggered action:

              - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.

              - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.

              - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of
              squares equal to your Reason score.

              - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the
              creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

              You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.
