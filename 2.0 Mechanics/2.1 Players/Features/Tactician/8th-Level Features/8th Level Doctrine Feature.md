      Your tactical doctrine grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level
      Doctrine Features table.


      ###### 8th-Level Doctrine Features Table

      | Doctrine   | Feature                            |

      | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |

      | Insurgent  | Bait and Ambush                    |

      | Mastermind | Pincer Movement                    |

      | Vanguard   | See Your Enemies Driven Before You |

      ##### Bait and Ambush

      You have trained your squad to be silent ambushers.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: >-
      When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you
      can spend 2 focus to let the character making the strike shift up to a
      number of squares equal to your Reason score and use the Hide maneuver as
      a free maneuver once during the shift. The creature can shift before or
      after the strike is resolved.

      ##### Pincer Movement

      You have trained your squad to coordinate their movements to maximize
      combat impact.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: >-
      When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you
      can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike shift up to a
      number of squares equal to your Reason score before the strike is
      resolved. If you didn't make the strike, you can make this shift as well.
      If you did make the strike, one ally within 10 squares of you can make
      this shift as well.

      ##### See Your Enemies Driven Before You

      You have trained your squad to maximize impact and break enemy lines when
      they attack.
  - name: Mark Benefit
    effect: When you or any ally makes a melee strike against a creature marked by
      you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike push
      the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. That
      character can then shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason
      score, ending this shift adjacent to the target.
