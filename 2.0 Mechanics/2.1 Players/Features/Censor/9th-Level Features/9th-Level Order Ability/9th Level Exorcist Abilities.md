          - roll: Power Roll + Might
            tier1: 5 + M damage; P < WEAK, the target is banished (save ends)

            tier3: 11 + M damage; P < STRONG, the target is banished (save ends)
          - name: Effect
            effect: This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures
              not native to your current world. If you know the target's true
              name, this ability has a double edge. While banished, the target
              is sent to another manifold in the timescape and removed from the
              encounter map. A banished target can do nothing but make saving
              throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time they do so. If the
              target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to
              the timescape.
