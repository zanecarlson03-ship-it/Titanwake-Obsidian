      Your censor order grants your choice of one of two heroic abilities.

      ##### 9th-Level Exorcist Abilities
      Choose one of the following abilities.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Banish
        cost: 11 Wrath
        flavor: You sever the target's tenuous connection to the world.
        keywords:
          - Melee
          - Strike
          - Weapon
        usage: Main action
        distance: Melee 1
        target: One creature
        effects:
          - roll: Power Roll + Might
            tier1: 5 + M damage; P < WEAK, the target is banished (save ends)
            tier2: 8 + M damage; P < AVERAGE, the target is banished (save ends)
            tier3: 11 + M damage; P < STRONG, the target is banished (save ends)
          - name: Effect
            effect: This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures
              not native to your current world. If you know the target's true
              name, this ability has a double edge. While banished, the target
              is sent to another manifold in the timescape and removed from the
              encounter map. A banished target can do nothing but make saving
              throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time they do so. If the
              target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to
              the timescape.

            tier3: 13 + P psychic damage; P < STRONG, frightened (save ends)
          - name: Effect
            effect: While frightened this way, if a target who is a leader or solo creature
              is winded, they take an extra 25 psychic damage. If a target
