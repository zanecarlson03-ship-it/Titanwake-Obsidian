      ##### Blessing of Compassion

      You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially
      engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another
      creature with a test.

      Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC
      of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and
      the first test made to influence them gains an edge.

      ##### Blessing of Comprehension

      You can interpret diagrams and charts even if you don't understand the
      language associated with them. You are considered fluent in all languages
      for the purpose of understanding the project source for any crafting or
      research project (see [Chapter 12: Downtime Projects](#page-307-2)).

      ##### Blessing of Fortunate Weather

      Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions
      within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather
      conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations.
      Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a
      benefit to you and your allies:
  - name: Clear
    effect: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or
      Navigate skills.
  - name: Foggy
    effect: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.
  - name: Overcast
    effect: You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.
  - name: Precipitation
    effect: >-
      When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on
      tests that use the Track skill.

      If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature
      who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other
      where their areas overlap.

      ##### Faithful Friend

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Faithful Friend
        flavor: An animal spirit is drawn to you, sharing their senses with you and
          serving you faithfully.
        keywords:
          - Magic
        usage: Main action
        distance: Self
        target: Self
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen.
              The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't
              physically interact with the world. While you are within 10
              squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that
              type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own
              surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action
              required). If the spirit takes any damage, they are dismissed and
              you take 1d10 psychic damage that can't be reduced in any way.
  - effect: |-
      ##### Grave Speech

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Grave Speech
        flavor: You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.
        keywords:
          - Magic
        usage: Maneuver
        distance: Melee 1
        target: One dead creature
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within
              the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if
              they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in
              life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and
              convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a
              creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise
              knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You
              can't use this ability on the same creature twice.
  - effect: |-
      ##### Hands of the Maker

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Hands of the Maker
        flavor: You craft objects with the power of your mind.
        keywords:
          - Magic
        usage: Maneuver
        distance: Self
        target: Self
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: You create a mundane object of size 1S or smaller. You can maintain a
              number of objects created this way equal to your Presence score.
              You can destroy an object created this way with a thought, no
              matter how far you are from it (no action required).
  - effect: >-
      ##### Inner Light


      Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is
      also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place
      a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a
      +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.

      ##### Inspired Deception

      The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that
      uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Presence
      on the test instead of another characteristic.

      ##### Oracular Visions

      Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you
      earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points.
      Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1
      fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an
      edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a
      respite.

      ##### Protective Circle

      You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on
      the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for
      24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action
      required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle
      can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature
      can't be targeted by strikes.

      ##### Revitalizing Ritual

      Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is
      also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The
      chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level
      that lasts until you finish another respite.

      ##### Sanctified Weapon

      As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the
      weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the
      weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.
