effects:
  - effect: You pick out the enemies most worthy of your wrath and place a divine
      judgment upon them, censoring them with the power of your god. You have
      the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Judgment
        flavor: You utter a prayer that outlines your foe in holy energy.
        keywords:
          - Magic
          - Ranged
        usage: Maneuver
        distance: Ranged 10

              The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you
              use this ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action
              required), or another censor judges the target.

              Whenever a creature judged by you uses a main action and is within
              your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to deal
              holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.

              When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use
              a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target.

              Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following
              free triggered actions:

              - When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you
              make a melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0
              until the end of the current turn, preventing them from shifting.

              - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power
              roll, you cause them to take a bane on the roll.

              - When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability
              with a potency that targets only one creature, the potency is
              reduced by 1 for that creature.

              - If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the
              creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

              You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time,
              even if multiple options are triggered by the same effect.
