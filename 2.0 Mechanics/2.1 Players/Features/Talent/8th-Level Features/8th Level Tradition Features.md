      Your talent tradition grants you two features, as shown on the 8th-Level
      Tradition Features table.


      ###### 8th-Level Tradition Features Table

      | Tradition   | Features                          |

      | ----------- | --------------------------------- |

      | Chronopathy | Doubling the Hours, Stasis Shield |

      | Telekinesis | Levitation Field, Low Gravity     |

      | Telepathy   | Mindlink, Universal Connection    |

      ##### Doubling the Hours

      While you have 5 or more Victories, you can undertake an additional
      respite activity during a respite.

      ##### Levitation Field

      You have the following ability.
    features:
      - type: feature
        feature_type: ability
        name: Levitation Field
        flavor: You manipulate the air around your allies so they can move as freely
          through the sky as you can.
        keywords:
          - Area
          - Psionic
        usage: Maneuver
        distance: 3 burst
        target: Each ally in the area
        effects:
          - name: Effect
            effect: Each target can fly until the start of your next turn, and can
              immediately shift up to their speed. You can also shift up to your
              speed. While flying, a target's stability is reduced to 0 and
              can't be increased.
          - cost: Spend 5 Clarity
            effect: The effects last for 1 hour instead.
  - effect: >-
      ##### Low Gravity


      Your mind can carry your body through tough times. You ignore difficult
      terrain and don't need to spend additional movement while prone.

      ##### Mindlink

      During a respite, you can choose a number of creatures up to your Reason
      score who you have communicated with using your Telepathic Speech feature,
      creating a telepathic link among all of you. Whenever a linked creature
      spends one or more Recoveries, each other linked creature can spend a
      Recovery.
