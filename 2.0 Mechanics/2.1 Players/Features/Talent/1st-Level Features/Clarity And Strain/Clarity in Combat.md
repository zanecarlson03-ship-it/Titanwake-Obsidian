effects:
  - effect: >-
      At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation
      tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity
      equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat,
      you gain 1d3 clarity.


      Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature is force
      moved, you gain 1 clarity.

      You can spend clarity you don't have, pushing that Heroic Resource into
      negative numbers to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason
      score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each
      negative point of clarity.

      Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic
      abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become
      strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even
      after you are no longer strained.

      You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of
      the encounter.
