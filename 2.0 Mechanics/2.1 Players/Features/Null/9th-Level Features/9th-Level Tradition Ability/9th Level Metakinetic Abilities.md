        distance: Melee 1
        target: One creature
        effects:
          - roll: Power Roll + Agility
            tier1: 7 + A psychic damage; I < WEAK, dazed
            tier2: 10 + A psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, dazed
            tier3: 13 + A psychic damage; I < STRONG, dazed
          - name: Effect
            effect: While dazed this way, the target takes psychic damage equal to twice
              your Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. If this
              ability causes a creature who is not a leader or solo creature to
              become winded, they are instead reduced to 0 Stamina. Any creature
              reduced to 0 Stamina by this ability is forgotten by all creatures
              of your level or lower in the timescape who are not present in the
              encounter. Loved ones of the forgotten creature retain a faint
              sense of melancholy. This effect can be reversed only at the
              Director's discretion.
