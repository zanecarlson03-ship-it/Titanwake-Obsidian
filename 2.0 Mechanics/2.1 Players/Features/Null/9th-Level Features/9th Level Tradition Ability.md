              become winded, they are instead reduced to 0 Stamina. Any creature
              reduced to 0 Stamina by this ability is forgotten by all creatures
              of your level or lower in the timescape who are not present in the
              encounter. Loved ones of the forgotten creature retain a faint
              sense of melancholy. This effect can be reversed only at the
              Director's discretion.
