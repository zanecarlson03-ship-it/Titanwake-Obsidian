effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: You conjure a size 2 rolling machine that appears in an unoccupied space
      within distance. The machine has 50 Stamina and immunity all to poison and
      psychic damage. It disappears at the end of the encounter, if its Stamina
      drops to 0, or if you are dying. When the machine first appears, make the
      following power roll once, targeting each enemy adjacent to it.
  - effect: Once on each subsequent turn, you can use a free maneuver to move the
      machine a number of squares up to your Intuition score then repeat the
      power roll.
    roll: Power Roll + Intuition
    tier1: 3 damage
    tier2: 5 damage
    tier3: 8 damage
