  - name: Effect
    effect: A size 2 statue rises out of the ground in an unoccupied space within
      distance and lasts until the end of the encounter. While within 3 squares
      of the statue, you gain 1 surge at the start of each of your turns. Each
      ally within 3 squares of the statue gains this same benefit. The statue is
      destroyed if it takes 20 or more damage. It has immunity all to poison and
      psychic damage.
