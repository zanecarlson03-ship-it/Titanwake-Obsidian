effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: Before the target dies, you can look at their stat block and force them
      to use one ability that is a main action or a maneuver. If the ability
      costs a Heroic Resource or Malice, the creature can use it without any
      cost. For the purpose of using this ability, your allies and enemies are
      the target's allies and enemies, and you decide who the ability targets.
