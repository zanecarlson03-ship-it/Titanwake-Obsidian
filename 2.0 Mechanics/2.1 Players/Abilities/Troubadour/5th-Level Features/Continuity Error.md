effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The target is split into two separate entities, one of which remains in
      the target's space while the other appears in an unoccupied space of your
      choice within distance. If the target is a creature, this creates a new
      creature under the Director's control. Each entity has half the original
      target's Stamina, is weakened, and takes 1d6 corruption damage at the
      start of each of their turns. If either entity is reduced to 0 Stamina,
      the other entity persists as the original entity and this effect ends. The
      effect also ends if both entities occupy the same space, causing them to
      automatically merge and combine their current Stamina.
