  - name: Effect
    effect: Until the end of the encounter, whenever you reduce a creature to 0
      Stamina using an ability, you can use a free triggered action to teleport
      an ally within distance of that ability into the creature's space in a
      plume of rose petals. You or the teleported ally can then make a melee
      free strike.
