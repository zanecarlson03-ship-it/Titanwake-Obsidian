effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Presence
    tier1: 7 + P sonic damage
    tier2: 10 + P sonic damage
    tier3: 13 + P sonic damage
  - name: Effect
    effect: The first time the target uses an ability before the start of your next
      turn, any effects from the ability's tier outcomes other than damage are
      negated for all targets. Ability effects that always happen regardless of
      the power roll work as usual.
