effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: At the end of each of your turns while this performance is active, you
      can choose up to a number of targets equal to your Presence score and
      teleport those targets to unoccupied spaces in the area. A target can't be
      teleported in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave
      them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative
      effect.
