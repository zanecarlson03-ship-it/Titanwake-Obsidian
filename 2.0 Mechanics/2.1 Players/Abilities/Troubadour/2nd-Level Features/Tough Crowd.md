    effect: The area is haunted by a swirling horde of phantoms until the end of the
      encounter. Allies can enter any square of the area without spending
      movement. At the end of each of your turns, you can make one power roll
      that targets each enemy in the area.
  - roll: Power Roll + Presence
    tier1: 5 corruption damage; M < WEAK, pull 1 toward the center of the area
    tier2: 9 corruption damage; M < AVERAGE, pull 2 toward the center of the area
    tier3: 12 corruption damage; M < STRONG, pull 3 toward the center of the area
