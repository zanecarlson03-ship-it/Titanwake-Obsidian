    effect: You use an ability that you have observed being used this combat round.
      The ability must have the Strike keyword, cost 5 or fewer of a Heroic
      Resource, and cost no Malice. When you make the strike, you use your
      Presence score for any power rolls, and any damage you deal is sonic
      damage.
