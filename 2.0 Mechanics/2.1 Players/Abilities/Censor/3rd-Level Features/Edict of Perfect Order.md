    effect: "Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a
      target uses an ability that costs Malice (see *[Draw Steel:
      Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), they take holy damage equal to
      three times your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an extra 2d6
      holy damage."
