effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: You conjure an elemental shield that protects the target until the end
      of your next turn. While the shield is active, the target can take the
      Defend main action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains
      30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or until the effect ends.
      If this temporary Stamina disappears, the effect ends and the shield
      explodes, dealing 10 damage to each enemy within 5 squares of the target.
  - name: Persistent 2
    effect: The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
