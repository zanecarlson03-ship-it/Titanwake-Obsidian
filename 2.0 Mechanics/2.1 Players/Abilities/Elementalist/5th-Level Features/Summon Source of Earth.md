    effect: >-
      A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance.
      The source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their
      speed and either taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is
      dismissed at the start of your next turn.

      The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their
      current Stamina throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and
      you use this ability again. They can't regain Stamina during the
      encounter. When the source's Stamina is reduced to 0, you can't use this
      ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.
  - name: Persistent 2
    effect: >-
