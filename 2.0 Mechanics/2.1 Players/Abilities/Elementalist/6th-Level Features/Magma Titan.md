effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: >-
      Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following benefits:

      - Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target becoming
      size 3. Each creature who is within the target's new space slides to the
      nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability. If the target doesn't have
      space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until
      the effect ends.

      - They have fire immunity 10.

      - Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score.

      - When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement
      distance gains a +2 bonus.

      - They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might
      power rolls.
  - name: Persistent 2
    effect: The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the
      start of your turn, the target can spend 2 Recoveries.
