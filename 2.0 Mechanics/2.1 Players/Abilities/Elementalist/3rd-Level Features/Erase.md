effects:
  - name: Special
    effect: The number of creatures you target with this ability is determined by
      your power roll.
  - roll: Power Roll + Reason
    tier1: One creature
    tier2: Two creatures
    tier3: Three creatures
  - name: Effect
    effect: Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). On their first
      turn while fading from existence, a target takes a bane on power rolls. At
      the end of their first turn, they have a double bane on power rolls. At
      the end of their second turn, they fade from existence for 1 hour, after
      which they reappear in their original space or the nearest unoccupied
      space.
