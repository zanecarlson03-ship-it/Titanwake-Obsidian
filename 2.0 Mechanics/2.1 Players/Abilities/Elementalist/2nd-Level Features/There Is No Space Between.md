    effect: >-
      You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces within distance, which
      last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a
      maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more
      than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that
      creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of
      their choice adjacent to the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into
      a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal
      in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

      At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can
      open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are
      present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when
      entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal
      chooses that enemy's destination portal.
