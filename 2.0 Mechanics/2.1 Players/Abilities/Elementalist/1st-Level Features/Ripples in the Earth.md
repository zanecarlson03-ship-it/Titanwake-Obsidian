    effect: You must be touching the ground to use this ability. Additionally, you
      can choose a square of ground in the area that is unoccupied or is
      occupied by you or any ally. A pillar of earth rises out of the ground in
      that square, with a height in squares up to your Reason score. The pillar
      can't collide with any creatures or objects, nor can it force creatures
      raised by it to collide with other creatures or objects.
