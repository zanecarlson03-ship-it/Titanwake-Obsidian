  - name: Effect
    effect: Until the start of your next turn, the target can move through solid
      matter, they ignore difficult terrain, and their movement can't provoke
      opportunity attacks. If the target ends their turn inside solid matter,
      they are forced out into the space where they entered it and this effect
      ends.

    effect: The effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
