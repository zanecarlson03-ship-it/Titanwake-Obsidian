      You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target, who can immediately quaff
      the potion (no action required). If they don't drink the potion right
      away, they must use the Use Consumable maneuver to consume it later. The
      potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter.

      A creature who drinks the potion receives benefits based on your power
      roll.
  - roll: Power Roll + Agility
    tier1: The creature's speed is increased by 2 until the end of the encounter.
    tier2: The creature can fly until the end of the encounter.
    tier3: The creature turns invisible until the end of their next turn.
