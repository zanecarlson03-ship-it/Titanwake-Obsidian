    effect: Each target can teleport up to 5 squares. For each target in addition to
      you who teleports away from or into a space adjacent to an enemy, that
      enemy takes fire damage equal to your Agility score. Additionally, a
      target who ends this movement in concealment or cover can use the Hide
      maneuver even if they are observed.
