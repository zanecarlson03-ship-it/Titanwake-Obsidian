      Each target takes acid, fire, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your
      Agility score.

      For each combat round that has passed since this ability was last used in
      the current encounter, the area increases by 1 and you gain 1 surge that
      must be used with this ability. After using the ability or at the end of
      the encounter, its area and surges are reset.
  - cost: Spend 2+ Insight
    effect: For every 2 insight spent, you increase the cube's size by 1 and gain 1
      surge that can be used only with this ability.
