effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Intuition
    tier1: 8 + I cold damage; M < WEAK, restrained (save ends)
    tier2: 11 + I cold damage; M < AVERAGE, restrained (save ends)
    tier3: 15 + I cold damage; M < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

    effect: While restrained this way, the target takes cold damage equal to your
      Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. Additionally, whenever
      the target damages another creature while restrained this way, any potency
      associated with the damage is reduced by 2.
