effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Intuition
    tier1: I < WEAK, the target loses their turn
    tier2: I < AVERAGE, the target loses their turn
    tier3: I < STRONG, the target loses their turn
  - name: Effect
    effect: If the target loses their turn, the round continues as if they had
      acted. A target who doesn't lose their turn takes psychic damage equal to
      twice your Intuition score for each main action they take until the end of
      their next turn.
