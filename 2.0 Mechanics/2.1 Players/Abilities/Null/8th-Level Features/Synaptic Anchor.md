effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The target takes half the damage, and if the triggering creature has I <
      AVERAGE, they are dazed (save ends). While the triggering creature is
      dazed this way, they take psychic damage equal to your Intuition score
      whenever they use a main action.
