    effect: Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability
      increases by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, each
      enemy who has I < AVERAGE and enters the area for the first time in a
      combat round or starts their turn there is bleeding (save ends). Each ally
      who enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts their
      turn there gains temporary Stamina equal to your Intuition score.
