  - name: Effect
    effect: Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability
      increases by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way,
      whenever an enemy in the area takes rolled damage, they take extra psychic
      damage equal to twice your Intuition score.
