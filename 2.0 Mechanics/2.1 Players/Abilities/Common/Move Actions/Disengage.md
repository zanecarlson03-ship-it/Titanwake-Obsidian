effects:
  - effect: When a creature takes the Disengage move action, they can shift 1
      square. Certain class features, kits, and other rules allow a creature to
      shift more than 1 square when they disengage. A creature who does so can
      break up their shift with their maneuver and main action however they
      wish.
