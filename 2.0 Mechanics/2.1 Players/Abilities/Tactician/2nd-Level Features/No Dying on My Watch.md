    effect: You move up to your speed toward the triggering ally, ending this
      movement adjacent to them or in the nearest square if you can't reach an
      adjacent square. The triggering ally can spend a Recovery and gains 5
      temporary Stamina for each enemy you came adjacent to during the move. You
      then make a power roll against the target.

    tier2: R < AVERAGE, the target is frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)
    tier3: R < STRONG, the target is frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)
