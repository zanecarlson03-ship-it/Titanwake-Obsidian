    effect: >-
      The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are
      dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your
      mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a
      creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you
      is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new
      target within distance.

      You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other
      tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same
      time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you
      to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.

      While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and
      allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against
      that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to
      deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to
      gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:

      - The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.

      - The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.

      - The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares
      equal to your Reason score.

      - If you damage a creature marked by you with a melee ability, the
      creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.

      You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger.
