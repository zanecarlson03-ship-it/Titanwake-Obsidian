  - name: Effect
    effect: You can shift 1 square. If the target is you, or if you end this shift
      adjacent to the target, the target takes half the damage. If the damage
      has any potency effect associated with it, the potency is decreased by 1.
  - cost: Spend 1 Focus
    effect: This ability's distance becomes Melee 1 + your Reason score, and you can
      shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score instead of 1
      square.
