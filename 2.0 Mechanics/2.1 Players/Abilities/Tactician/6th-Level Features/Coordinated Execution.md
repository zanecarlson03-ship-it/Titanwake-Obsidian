    effect: If the target of the triggering ability is not a leader or solo
      creature, they are reduced to 0 Stamina. If the target of the triggering
      ability is a minion, the entire squad is killed. If the target of the
      triggering ability is a leader or solo creature, the triggering ability's
      power roll automatically obtains a tier 3 outcome.
