    effect: One ally within 10 squares of you can use a heroic ability against the
      target as a free triggered action without spending any of their Heroic
      Resource, as long as they have enough Heroic Resource to pay for the
      ability. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina before the chosen ally has
      used their ability, the ally can pick a different target.
