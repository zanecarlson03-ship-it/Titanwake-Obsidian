  target: One enemy
  type: feature/ability/talent/6th-level-feature
effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The target has damage weakness 5 until the end of your next turn.
      Whenever the target takes damage while they have this weakness, they are
      knocked prone.
  - name: Strained
    effect: This ability gains the Strike keyword as the vision hurts the target's
      psyche. You make a power roll, then are weakened (save ends).
  - roll: Power Roll + Presence
    tier1: 8 + P psychic damage
    tier2: 13 + P psychic damage
    tier3: 17 + P psychic damage
