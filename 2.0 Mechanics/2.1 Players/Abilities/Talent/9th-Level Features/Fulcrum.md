effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: Make a power roll to determine the area of this ability. Each target is
      vertical pushed 6 squares. You can target only objects of size 1L or
      smaller.
  - roll: Power Roll + Reason
    tier1: 2 burst
    tier2: 3 burst
    tier3: 4 burst
  - name: Strained
    effect: You can choose to reduce the size of the burst by 2 (to a minimum of 1
      burst) to give the forced movement distance a +2 bonus. You take half the
      total damage all targets take from forced movement.
