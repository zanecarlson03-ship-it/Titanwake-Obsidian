effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The aura lasts until the start of your next turn. Whenever an enemy
      targets an ally in the area with a ranged ability, the ability is negated
      on the ally and reflected back at the enemy. The ability deals half the
      damage to the enemy that it would have dealt to the ally and loses any
      additional effects.
  - name: Strained
    effect: The size of the aura increases by 1. Whenever your aura reflects an
      ability, you take 2d6 damage and forget a memory, as determined by you and
      the Director.
