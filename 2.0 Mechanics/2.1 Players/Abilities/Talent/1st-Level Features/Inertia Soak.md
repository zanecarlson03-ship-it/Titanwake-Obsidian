effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced
      movement until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target enters a
      square while under this effect, they can push one adjacent creature up to
      a number of squares equal to your Reason score. When pushing an ally, the
      target can ignore that ally's stability. A creature can only be force
      moved this way once a turn.
  - name: Strained
    effect: You are weakened (save ends). While you are weakened this way, whenever
      you are force moved, the forced movement distance gains a +5 bonus.
