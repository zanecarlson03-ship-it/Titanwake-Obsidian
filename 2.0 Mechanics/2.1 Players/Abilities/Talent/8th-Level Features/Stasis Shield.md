effects:
  - name: Effect
    effect: The target is teleported to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, taking
      no damage and suffering no additional effects if this movement would get
      them out of harm's way.
  - name: Strained
    effect: You can't target yourself, and you take the damage and any additional
      effects instead of the target.
