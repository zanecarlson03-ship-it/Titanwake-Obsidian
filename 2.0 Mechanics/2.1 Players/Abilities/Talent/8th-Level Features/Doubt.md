    effect: "This ability gains an edge against a target with a soul (see *[Draw
      Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*). After you make the power
      roll, you or one ally within distance have a double edge on the next power
      roll you make before the end of the encounter."

    effect: You feel dispirited until you finish a respite. If you obtain a tier 3
