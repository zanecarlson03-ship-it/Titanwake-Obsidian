  type: kit-ability/martial-artist
effects:
  - roll: Power Roll + Might or Agility
    tier1: 5 + M or A damage
    tier2: 8 + M or A damage; you can swap places with the target
    tier3: 11 + M or A damage; you can swap places with the target
  - name: Effect
    effect: If you obtain a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome and can't swap places with the
      target because one or both of you is too big to fit into the swapped
      space, you both remain in your original spaces and the target takes 1
      extra damage.
