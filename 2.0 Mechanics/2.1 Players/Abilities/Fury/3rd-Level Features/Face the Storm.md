    effect: Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, each creature you
      make a melee strike against who has P < AVERAGE is taunted until the end
      of their next turn. Additionally, when you use an ability that deals
      rolled damage against any enemy taunted by you, the ability deals extra
      damage equal to twice your Might score and increases its potency by 1.
